Description:
My app mimics a mobile banking app.  It has a functional login screen that accepts the credentials of three users.  After logging in, users are able to compare 
their funds with the other two users, view their account details (username and password), request funds from other users, and transfer funds to other users.  

How to play:
Login using one of the three users' credentials.  Credentials are stored in the usernamesArr and passwordsArr.  Ex: To login as the first user, input "user1" and 
"ps1" on the login screen.  Navigate to other screens in the app by selecting the respective buttons.

Interesting Features:
1. For the request and transfer screens, users must input the username of another user.  My app verifies the username before allowing the request/transfer.
2. Users can not request/transfer negative funds.  The amount of funds are verified before allowing the request/transfer.
